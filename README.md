## My Task
Create a simple daily planner application that allows a user to schedule hourly events by modifying starter code.

## Technology Used
Browser run and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery and the Moment.js library.

## Acceptance Criteria
I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
[x] THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
[x] THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
[x] THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
[x] THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
[x] THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
[x] THEN the saved events persist
